        nature when she enters the woods for the first time.

        Creation of a legendary beetle with an activity sheet. The main goal of
        the activity is to make drawing fun and less scary by letting the artist
        (no matter their level) create their own magical insects. 

        (The activity is in french, but you can still use it and play with the dice !)

        into a story... It was a no-brainer: Summoning! Maybe it's because I
        always play wizards in role-play ;)"
