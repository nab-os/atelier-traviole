        a commissioned trio of whimsical mini-fairies paintings. This piece

        Creation of a legendary beetle with an activity sheet. The main goal of
        the activity is to make drawing fun and less scary by letting the artist
        (no matter their level) create their own magical insects. 

        (The activity is in french, but you can still use it and play with the dice !)
