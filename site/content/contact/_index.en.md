description: >-
  I am a kidlit illustrator, currently based in Strasbourg (France, 67). In life
  as well as in art, I am trully a melting pot: I am proud of my maurician and
  belgian heritage, but I am also a real dabbler. After studying engineering and
  education, I now devote myself 100% to art. 


  My main interests are: education and discoveries, magical and full of humour folktales, but also board games and quests! 
contact: Publishing house, author or fellow illustrator looking for partnership,
  company or individual, tell me your ideas! If one of my past projets inspires
  you, or if you think we would be a great team, don't hesitate to contact me!
