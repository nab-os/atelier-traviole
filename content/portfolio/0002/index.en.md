      manuscript written with my Instagram followers. This double page spread
      focuses on the couple and their wedding memory. I really enjoyed
      creating their old sepia photo, I find them adorable.

    description: " This is a piece from a commissioned trio of whimsical
      mini-fairies paintings. I had a lot of fun the composition and the

      strawberries to warm up!"
