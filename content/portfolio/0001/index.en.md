    description: Dummy book cover for the illustration exercise based on an original
      manuscript written with my Instagram followers. I decided to focus this
      cover art on the main character, with a reminder of the wallpaper of his
      family home in the background.

    description: "Illustration based on a prompt draw: Monster and Creativity. When
      I drew these words, my first intuition was the monster in a child's
      bedroom closet. But I also thought of role-playing games (especially
      D&D). The more time passes, the more I imagine my future life in a
      fantasy world!"

    description: "Illustration showing the magical beetles from the Beetle Factory.
      I wondered how they would appear if we had to integrate beetle creation
      into a story... It was a no-brainer: Summoning! Maybe it's because I
      always play wizards in role-play ;)"
