    description: The first time ever someone paid me for art ! This is a piece from
      a commissioned trio of whimsical mini-fairies paintings. This piece
      really sparked my love for textures and plants in art (especially the
      Monstera!)

    description: >-
      Creation of a legendary beetle with an activity sheet. The main goal of
      the activity is to make drawing fun and less scary by letting the artist
      (no matter their level) create their own magical insects.

      (The activity is in french, but you can still use it and play with the dice !)
