    description: "This piece is part of a commissioned trio of paintings with the theme : Alsatian landscapes, the French region where I currently live. For this piece, I focused on stylizing the plants, looking for modern ways to illustrate the countryside. Of the entire triptych, my favorite detail is the group of small cows in the background!"
