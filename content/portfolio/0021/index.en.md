A lot of love for this card that makes you want to write down your resolutions, look forward to the future and travel far and wide!

    description: "Fanart of two of my favourite video games: Stardew Valley and Animal Crossing. For this piece, which is actually a series of duets, I played around with imagining what the villagers of Stardew would look like in the Animal Crossing universe while keeping the codes of Animal Crossing New Horizons. My favourite of the series is Sam, I think he's really fun and spontaneous!"
